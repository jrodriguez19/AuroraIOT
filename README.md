# AuroraIOT
AuroraIOT is an innovative Python and Django-based application designed for real-time energy consumption monitoring in buildings. The system leverages energy sensors, specifically the pzem-004t sensors, which are seamlessly integrated with an ESP32 microcontroller. This microcontroller efficiently captures energy consumption data at a rate of every 3 seconds. Subsequently, it transmits this data to the central AuroraIOT backend through a Wi-Fi connection, utilizing the MQTT protocol for secure and efficient communication. This system ensures accurate and timely energy consumption insights for optimized building management.
