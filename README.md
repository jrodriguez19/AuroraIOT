# AuroraIOT
AuroraIOT is a Python and Django-based application designed for real-time energy consumption monitoring in buildings. The system utilizes pzem-004t sensors seamlessly integrated with an ESP32 microcontroller to capture energy consumption data. This data is then transmitted to the central AuroraIOT backend via Wi-Fi, employing the MQTT protocol for secure and efficient communication. This system provides accurate and timely insights for optimized building management.
